                            physically,
                            mentally, morally, or by blocking their access to education</mark>. While progress has been

                        world in the fight against child labour, there’s still a long way to go.
                        There is no universally accepted definition of child labour. Varying definitions of the term are
                        used by international organisations, non-governmental organisations, trade unions and other
                        interest
                        groups.
                        There are also varying opinions about who exactly counts as a child. While <mark>international
                            conventions

                        cultures

                    India sadly is home to the largest number of child labourers in the world. A growing phenomenon
                    is
                    children being used as domestic workers in urban areas. The conditions in which children work
                    are
                    completely unregulated and they are often made to work without food, with very low wages,
                    resembling
                    slavery. There are cases of physical, sexual and emotional abuse of child domestic workers. A
                    Ministry
                    of Labour notification has made child domestic work as well as employment of children in dhabas,
                    tea
                    stalls and restaurants "hazardous" occupations.
                    In fact, child labour including hazardous forms of work can be found in many countries. In the
                    US,
                    for example, underage workers are often employed in agriculture, with a high proportion of them
                    coming
                    from either immigrant or ethnic-minority families. Working in farms, they are exposed to extreme
                    heat,
                    sharp tools and heavy machinery as well as toxic pesticides. A US government report from 2018
                    revealed
                    that half of work-related deaths among children in the US occur in agriculture.

                <aside>
                    <p>Many children in hazardous and dangerous jobs are in danger of injury or even death. Between
                        2000
                        and
                        the year 2020, the vast majority of new workers, citizens and new consumers — whose skills
                        and
                        needs
                        will build the world’s economy and society — will come from developing countries. Over that
                        20-year
                        period, some 730 million people have joined the world’s workforce — more than all the people
                        employed in the most developed nations in 2000.
